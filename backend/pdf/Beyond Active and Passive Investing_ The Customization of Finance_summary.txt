For their encouragement and support during the seemingly endless hours of research and discussion, we are grateful to Viviana Herrera-Blay, Genevieve Blay, Gary Doyle, Shonnie Leibowitz, Molly Reinganum, Max Taytelbaum, and, especially, Brianna Cathleen, whose birth spurred the authors to completion! The biggest challenge and threat to current pooled fund structures comes from the rise of direct or personalized indexing in conjunction with separately managed accounts enabled by technological advances that continue to expand capabilities while reducing costs. ” This article presented the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and introduced the concept of the “market” (cap-weighted) portfolio, contrasted the kinds of risk that should be rewarded by higher return with those that should not, and even - tually provided the theoretical foundations for both active and passive investing. One of the earliest records of a pooled investment fund comes from an enterprising Dutch merchant and broker in Amsterdam named Abraham van Ketwich, who perceived an opportunity to offer small investors the chance to gain exposure to a diversified pool of investments in Austria, Denmark, Germany, Spain, Sweden, and Russia as well as in colonial plantations in Central and South America.5 In 1774, van Ketwich solicited subscriptions (certificates of partial ownership) to a trust labeled “Eendragt Maakt Magt, ” which translates in English to “Unity Creates Strength, ” a motto used by the Dutch Republic. In the spirit of this finding, other studies by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the American Institute for Economic Research over different time periods also noted that investment company fund performance was not typically superior to that of a representative average or common stock index. Yet, on a worldwide basis, risk-oriented strategic beta equity index funds accounted for only $86 billion at the end of 2021.11 These advanced customization tools are not nearly as widely understood or accepted as those based on more intuitive concepts, such as growth, value, and dividend yield. A taxable investor, with the aid of asset managers informed by ana - lytics, computing algorithms, and other intellectual property, will be able to judiciously realize gains and losses to maximize after-tax returns while still closely matching the performance of the S&P 500. But how many financial advisers will have the expertise, tools, and resources to develop pro - prietary total solutions that incorporate risk, return, taxes, and preferences over the now thou - sands of unbundled index securities plus active funds on a highly customized and individual basis? Another possibility would be for small and midsize financial advisers to turn to asset manage - ment firms to provide the tools and analytics needed to create highly customized portfolio solu - tions for end clients that would already include a path to implementation. In addition, such a firm will also develop, curate, deliver, and service the tools and analytics to support small and midsize financial advis - ers who can implement highly customized total portfolios for the adviser’ s client—what we’ve previously called a hyper-managed separate account.
